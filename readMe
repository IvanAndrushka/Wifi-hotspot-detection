Wifi hotspot detection based on power measurements coming from a set of sensors.

Given a sensor network, there is a token that walks around the network. 
Each time the token goes through an agent (sensor), it measures the power of the signal.
This way it is possible to refine the position estimate and the probability of an agent being the hotspot.
This process is modelled as a Markov chain and it is also numerically simulated using Monte Carlo runs to show that the proabilities tend to the theoretical Markov model.
